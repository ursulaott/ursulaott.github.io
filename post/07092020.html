            It's the first week of my internship and I have been awake before 5am every day for the past 4 days. Due to timezones I have to be awake 3 hours earlier than my east coast comrades. I am no longer in passable physical or mental condition. My entire brain is a shitpost now. I watched Naruto instead of paying attention to the video call meetings today. Casey said he has just been playing sudoku all of the time and Tamar was playing with her dog. I feel like one of the people in Liar's Poker tbh, maybe I am. <br><br>
            Things are not good circumstantially but I have been pretty happy lately so that's a thing! The SSRIs are finally kicking in or something like that maybe. I don't have enough brain power to write anything coherent but maybe I'll look back on this and laugh.

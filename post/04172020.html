          What do you do when the things you used to enjoy aren't fun anymore?<br><br>
          This was one of the biggest questions I faced during my first serious depressive episode near the end of high school. I had a great set of hobbies: a place on a few sports teams at my school, some beginner coding projects, and plenty of art supplies that I used to make all sorts of paintings and drawings. In a time where I was already burnt out from school and college applications, it would have been extremely helpful to be able to use one of these hobbies to unwind. <br><br>
          Eventually after trying many times, I found that none of my hobbies made me feel any better. Often they made me feel worse. I was suffering from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia">anhedonia</a>. In my opinion this is one of the worst symptoms depressionâ€”you lose both the motivation to do activities that bring enjoyment, and the ability to enjoy activities. The simultaneous loss of both cause and effect is extremely disorienting and can quickly cause a feeling of hopelessness.<br><br>
          I wasn't able to snap out of it immediately, and I certainly didn't resume all of my previous hobbies, but I was able to return back to a state I can call normal. I'm also sure that moving across the country for college and meeting new trusted friends to have fun with has undeniably helped snap me out of the depressive state as well. Also in purely economic terms, with all of my obligations and assignments during the semester, free time really felt like a gift.  <br><br>
          I'm writing this because I'm experiencing a milder form of anhedonia right now. The quarantine and my university's pass/fail grading policy has allowed me to see which of the things I do that I enjoy, and which I couldn't care less about. I realize now that things even as large as the choice of my major I based on other people's opinions and advice. <br><br>
          For the first time, I have also been starting to think about what my life would be like if I lived it 100% for myself. Maybe it sounds crazy that I have lived for 20 years without considering what I wanted for mysel, but it's easy for me to live to make someone else proud. Talking with a friend today, I realized that no matter how much effort I spend living for someone else, they can ultimately always leave or die or something, so I might as well live for myself. <br><br>
          It might be easier for me to go with the flow in the short run, but I understand now that if I want to enjoy my life in the long run I have to be more selfish. I feel it is of extreme and urgent importance that I need to find things that make me, and nobody else, happy. I'm going to take some time and do some cheesy activities I find online (like creating a vision board lol) to help find what I actually like doing in life. Maybe I'll even embarass myself and post them here.

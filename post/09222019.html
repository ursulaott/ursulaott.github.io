            I'm gonna say it: I am so tired of slow websites, unreadable websites, portfolios with ugly colors, any font in the "decorative" section, all of it.<br><br>
            Design isn't about aesthetics, although they are related. I think many creators of modern times have forgotton this, or perhaps never learned it in the first place. As my mentor says, "content is king and context is god". I want to try to implement both parts of this statement into the design of this blog.<br><br>
            First, we have "content is king". This blog is focused on the content that I create. There is not much else here.<br><br>
            Second, we have "context is god". I interpret this as to be saying something about structure and hierarchy. Information is useless without some sort of structure and containerizarion. I want topics, chronology, and content to be easily discernible. This is achieved visually through typography and hierarchies. <br><br>
            As humans, we have limited time. Simplicity on the web can allow us to spend more time on things we actually enjoy. Companies nowadays are fighting to the death for the valuable viewer eyes on their site to bring in ad revenue. It's so refreshing to view a site that is not trying to sell me anything, and is easy to use. We don't like to be sold stuff. It's time to give the people what they want. <br><br>
            So, what do we take away from this? If you have control of any web content, I challenge you to minimize and simplify it as much as you can. Your readers will probably thank you.

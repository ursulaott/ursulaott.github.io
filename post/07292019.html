            I bullet journaled for about 2 or 3 years straight in high school. I would make entries daily, along with monthly spreads and additional organizational pages like do to lists, goals lists, and decorations. I am incredibly proud of my jornals and they tell a lot of my stories and bring back many memories.<br><br>
            The habit has fallen off these past few months but I'd like to start it up again. So much of my life has moved to the digital space but it's nice to have this one remaining analog component. It almost grounds me in a way.<br><br>
            In the future, I will share a post about how I set up my bullet journal, because I know that everyone does it differently. <br><br>

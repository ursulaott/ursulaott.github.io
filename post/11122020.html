            Today I went on a little outing to a nearby outdoor preserve. I got to hike up the side of this small mountian to take some nice pictures of the beach.<br><br>

            It was pretty windy and a little bit difficult to make the ascent but overall a good experience. I also saw some stingrays in the water so I guess I should be careful next time I swim there.

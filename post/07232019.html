            So, like most other obnoxious minimalists, I take some amount of pride in owning a low number of physical objects. Or, to be honest, I did. Over time, I inevitably accumulate more "things", and I have to periodically declutter. Two of the hardest categories for me are clothing and books.<br><br>

            I decided it would help in my decluttering to take an inventory of all of my belongings, for 2 reasons. First, just to keep track in a objective sense. Second, I believe that this process will help me realize I have too much, and help me in the decluttering process. <br><br>

            Things I have with me right now<br>
            <ul><li>Olive green hydroflask</li>
                <li>iPhone 6s with case and charging cable</li>
                <li>MacBook pro 13 inch with charging cable</li>
                <li>Wallet</li>
                <li>Self-care items (chapstick, hair ties, hairbrush, toothbrush)</li>
                <li>Men's dress shoes</li>
                <li>Black jeans</li>
                <li>Black T shirt</li>
                <li>Socks & undergarments</li>
                <li>Grey Patagonia Fleece</li>
            </ul>

            That is already 10 items! (More if you count differently). These are all essentials, but I have a lot of things at home that I use much less. I also have things stored in California that I don't use at all right now, and a box of winter clothes and room decor somewhere in NYC that will be delivered to my dorm at the beginning of next semester.<br><br>

            The results of my inventory of all of my things will come in the next post. I made a list, but I'm not sure I'll share it just yet. For sure, my goal is to get rid of at least 20% of what I own right now before I leave back to California. <br><br>

            The current state of the world can really only be described as chaos at this point. I don't know what to say. I feel powerless to help the state of anything. I'm lucky enough to live in a privledged bubble, so I largely encounter this chaos tangentially, but I still see it happening. <br><br>
            June is pride month, so under normal circumstances the LGBTQ communtiy would be celebrating. However as a white cis LGBTQ person, it's also easy to forget that the first pride was a riot started by black transgender women, to police police brutality.

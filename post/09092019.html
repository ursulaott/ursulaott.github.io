        <h2> distance formula </h2>
        <p> 09.09.2019 </p>
        <p>
            I know it's not too pc to say this, but I am "pretty OCD" about a lot of things. I scored very very high in neuroticism in the big 5 personality index (also high in disagreeableness... go figure). But overall I am not a chill person and my anxiety overcomes my better judgement 99% of the time, much to the annoyance of anyone that's close to me.<br><br>
            Some people that are close to me have even remarked that my tendencies make them frustrated and wish that I would stop.<br><br>
            Because of this, I decided that I am going to create distance. I figured, that if I spread out my time over a lot of different activities and fill my days with many obligations, I can create distance. No one person has to deal with me very often, and I will be more focused on getting things done than worrying or overthinking.<br><br>
            More things to do = seeing any one individual person less = less thinking, more doing. <br><br>
            Or at least, I hope it works out like that. <br><br>

        <p><small>this might sound a little depressing, but honestlty it's the best i've got at this point</small></p>

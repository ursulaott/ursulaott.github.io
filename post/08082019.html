            I used to hate kale. My dad would always cook it until it had no texture except slime and no taste. Kale chips were fine, but they were chips for god's sake so of course they tasted good. Health benefits are typically negated when you chipify a food. <br><br>
            I started using kale in smoothies for the health benefits a few months ago, but I still thought I hated the taste. <br><br>
            As a plant, I find kale to be very interesting. Aside from its striking visual appearance, it contains some chemicals like oxalic acid (toxic), as well as vital nutrients like iron, calcium, and a bunch of vitamins.<br><br>
            This summer I have ventured further into kale land, eating it raw in salads. I have even discovered a salad combination that I love and have been eating it a lot lately.<br><br>
            The recipe for my kale salad requires:
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 cup of raw kale, in 1 inch by 2 inch pieces (de-stemmed)</li>
                <li>0.5 cup of cooked quinoa, cooled</li>
                <li>0.5 cup of shelled edamame</li>
                <li>1 tbsp of dried cranberries</li>
                <li>a sprinkle of mixed nuts</li>
                <li>some shredded carrots</li>
                <li>2tbsp dressing of your choice</li>
            </ul>

            What I like about this salad is I can put the ingredients into a container to refrigerate for a few days and it won't get limp and sad like most other salads will. Note: you MUST not put the dressing on the salad until the day you're going to eat it or it <i>will</i> get sad and limp.<br><br>
            The nutritional info for this salad is:
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Protein</td>
                    <td>21.1g</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Fat</td>
                    <td>23.7g | 1.5g saturated</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Carbohydrates </td>
                    <td>56.9g | 13.6g fiber | 20.8g sugar</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            It's kind of a lot of sugar but if you're concerned about that sort of thing you can ditch the dried cranberries. And that's how I maybe sort of almost enjoy eating kale now.

            This summer, I arrived in New York City with one medium suitcase and one carry on. It contained almost everything I needed. Over these past two months, I have acculumated many, many things that I don't really need. Also, because I use many of my belongings heavily, things have become broken, repaired over and over, and worn-down past the point of optimial usability. <br><br>
            Now, in a few weeks I must return with the same suitcase, but I now own far to many things to fit inside. It's time to downsize.<br><br>
            One of my favorite books of all time is "Goodbye, Things: On Minimalist Living" by Japanese ultraminimalist Fumio Sasaki. Every time I think I have too much, I give this book a skim, and I realize the problems that have occurred. The format of the book is such that you can open to almost any page and recieve a condensed jewel of minimalist wisdom. I can't reccomend it enough.<br><br>
            After my decision to downsize, I decided to inventory all of the things that I own (minus food items at least, I didn't think it made sense to count them).<br><br>
            In my initial count, I had 81 items of clothing. I decided to cut this down to 60, about a 25% decrease. Of course, this does not include my heavy winter clothes in storage, or my few things at home in California.<br><br>
            I also counted 73 other items around that I own, which I am cutting to 56.<br><br>
            Overall, this is 154 items, cut down to 116. I know this is not perfect, and I do own more things that are not currently with me, but I'm happy with it. <br><br>
            So, how will I get rid of my things? I sell some of my more valuable clothing online. New York City has plenty of shops that sell secondhand items, and will buy used items from you. I plan to sell as many of my clothes and books as I can through these stores. Otherwise, I will donate them. <br><br>
            I'm always pleasantly surprised by how light and energized I feel after decluttering. It's worth thinking about how so many of our possessions weigh us down more than we'd like them to. <br><br>

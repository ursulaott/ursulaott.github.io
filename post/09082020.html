            Well! It's the first day of class in my junior year. And my last day in California. My first 100% all online all remote semester and first time living on a landmass where I know nobody. <br><br>
            It's an exciting time for me. This semester I really get to branch out more and take classes that are personally interesting to me like things about the history of china and stuff about open source dev. <br><br>
            Will update again after I move! Excited for this new chapter to start.

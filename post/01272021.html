            This week I read <i>Notes from a Dead House</i> by Fyodor Dostoevsky. The semi-autobiographical work details the experience of prisoners in a Siberian labor camp. My professor called it "the orange is the new black of the 1860s" which I found to be quite apt. The work is truly a study of what it means to be human and civilized, and the astonishing ability of man to adapt to any circumstance. <br><br>

            I rate <i>No Longer Human</i> 4 out of 5 stars.

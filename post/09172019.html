          Overall, lots of bad things are happening to me right now. I am in a
          state of total upheval in a lot of ways, but I am still proud of myself. I'm being resilient. <br><br>
          Self care is becoming more of a priority now, and I am trying to follow as best
          as I can the old mantra of not becoming concerned with things I cannot control.<br><br>
          I think the Buddha was on to something when he said that desire causes suffering. I think I'm going to read further into his teachings, and hopefully they can help me.

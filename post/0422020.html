            I don't need words, they weigh me down, you understand anyways. These bonds never really die. Trusting without effort. You're not perfect, just slightly to the left of it, a little rumpled. If I could take away all of your sadness for myself I'd do it in a second. I wouldn't even notice. <br><br>
            You makes me curious about life in a way I wasn't before. A dangerous thought.<br><br>
            If I stay alive, could my life could always be this good?<br><br>
            Will our paths converge again?<br><br>

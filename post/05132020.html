          I've suffered from atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, since my early childhood. Most of the time it's not noticable at all, but sometimes flares can derail my entire life. Since the main purpose of the skin is to protect the body, and I've always wondered why and how mine fails so badly. I've been doing some research about the chemistry, biology, and anatomy of skin, and I'm going to document my findings here.<br><br>
          First, the basics. The skin is composed of two main layers, the dermis and epidermis, which are in turn composed of more layers. Skin cells are generally born in the lower layers, and migrate upwards. The outermost layer (stratum corneum) is larely made of dead skin. This is why we can satisfyingly exfoliate the outer laye without much pain. <br><br><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/wp-content/uploads/sites/142/2016/03/502_Layers_of_epidermis.jpg">
          Through my research I've been able to detemine that the root cause of eczema is a genetic mutation that causes me to have less filaggrin than I should. Fillagrin is a protein produced by keratinocytes, and it is the main component of keratohyalin granules in the stratum granulosum. These keratohyalin granules serve a vital role in keeping the skin moisturized. Additionally they are also filled with histidine- and cysteine-rich proteins that appear to bind the keratin filaments together.<br><br>

        <h2> goals </h2>

            I have tried many methods of setting goals in the past. These have ranged from daily goals in a bullet journal, weekly goals, monthly, yearly, you name it.<br><br>
            After a few years of trial and error, to be honest I'm still not sure what the best method of goal-setting is. However, this time I am going to try a new experiment: goals for the semester. <br><br>
            As a college student, my life revolves around the timeline of a semester. It should only be fitting that my personal goals should follow along with this structure.<br><br>
            It's still July, and the semester doesn't start for over a month, but I still want to start planning so I make sure my goals are realistic and achievable. <br><br>
            I have started a list of things that I want to achieve by the end of the semester, aka December 2019:
            <ul>
                <li>Work, and save/invest $2,000</li>
                <li>Minimize what I own by 20%</li>
                <li>Establish a consistent workout schedule, with lifting</li>
                <li>Secure leads for a job next summer</li>
                <li>Maintain my same GPA or higher</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

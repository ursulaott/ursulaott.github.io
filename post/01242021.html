            This week, or rather today specifically, I read <i>No Longer Human</i> by Osamu Dazai. The book was rather short and I was able to finish it all in just a few hours. Dazai's prose struck me in a way few things have. I think it's probably bad that I can relate to a lot of the things in this book, but nevertheless I do. I was close to tears at points and I'm sure this book will remain on my mind for a long time. <br><br>

            I rate <i>No Longer Human</i> 5 out of 5 stars.

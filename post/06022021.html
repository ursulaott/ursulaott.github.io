            In 2021 I have read quite a few books so far (17 to be precise), and at a much greater complexity level than the last time I attempted this challenge. I'm trying to practice reading fiction and history rather than my default nonfiction science/tech/economics/businesss books. Especially within the genre of "The Great Russian Novel", I found myself struggling in ways I haven't felt since childhood.<br><br>
            Themes I have been drawn to this period are treachery, depression, and most of all war (in the historical context and others). For some reason I have been craving violence in all forms of media- I suspect a certain culprit- but I have taken to playing games where I can kill on a massive scale and it gives me great satisfaction. In terms of chronological progression. Dostoevsky's exploration of human treachery grasped me in the winter months, then I had a deep dive into Osamu Dazai's few greatly depressing and incredibly touching works, and I'm now in an era of enjoying history.  <br><br>
            The foremost of my recent reads in the past few weeks is Robert Greene's "The 48 Laws of Power". It's been hard for me to put this book down, the examples and principles he puts forth have really opened my eyes in terms of strategic thinking about all social hierarchies and interactions. Now that I have the freedom to craft my identity practically from scratch I will be keeping these ideas in mind. <br><br>
            In 2020 I spent a lot of time stagnating, so to speak "rotting in my room", to a state where I almost felt I was already dead. Being an adult is so weird because nobody will help you anymore. In fact, nobody will even notice you're about to die. I think I'm trying to avoid that now. I keep losing more and more friends, and maybe it's a sign that the area of life just isn't for me or I'm not cut out for it. Hopefully the challenge and routine of the workplace will be enough to keep me from "rotting" again. <br><br>
            Upcoming in terms of books, I have Anna Karenina, Capital in the 21st Century, On War, and The People In The Trees. I guess I'll be back at some point in the future to talk about how much I liked those.

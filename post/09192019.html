            Most of the aspects of my life are pretty minimal. My old personal website was not. It was time for a change. I looked at Jekyll, Wordpress, and some other technologies, but none of them really fit what I was looking for.
            This led to me deciding to make my own website from scratch, which is probably the project you're currently looking at. I was heavily influenced by Leo Babauta's blog, as well as the new york city subway system typography. I'm a big Helvetica fan.
            Anyways this is my venture into elegant and minimal web design.

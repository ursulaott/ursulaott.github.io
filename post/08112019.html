            The title of this post of course refers to <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_and_Nothingness" target="_blank">Being and Nothingness</a>.<br><br>
            Some years ago I had a strange obsession with existentialist writings. Nothing else within the humanities (save for art, my first true love) interested me. Yet I would stay awake so long into the night reading my anthology of the "top hits of 19th and early 20th century". <br><br>
            My favorites were Camus, de Beauvoir, and Sartre. I was not a fan of Nietzsche, though I agreed with his antichristian sentiments as an act of rebellion against my parochical secondary school. <br><br>
            Dealing with severe dissociation and derealization episodes, reading <i>The Stranger</i> and <i>Being and Nothingness</i> made me feel so understood by these long-dead intellectuals who had no concept of a sad girl in the 21st century. <br><br>
            From time to time I catch myself living in what Sartre calls bad faith, moreso now than ever. Living alone has allowed me to step outside of it and reconnect with my inner sense of (non)existence.<br><br>
            The dissociation still comes and lasts long enough at times for me to question if it will genuinely ever end. I find solace in knowing, that at least to Sartre, the fact that I can exist as nothingness is nothing much to worry about. <br><br>

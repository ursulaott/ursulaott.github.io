          What do you do when the things you used to enjoy aren't fun anymore?<br><br>
          This was one of the biggest questions I faced during my first serious depressive episode near the end of high school. I had a great set of hobbies: a place on a few sports teams at my school, some beginner coding projects, and plenty of art supplies that I used to make all sorts of paintings and drawings. In a time where I was already burnt out from school and college applications, it would have been extremely helpful to be able to use one of these hobbies to unwind. <br><br>
          But then, out of nowhere, my hobbies started making me feel worse. I was suffering from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia" target="_blank">anhedonia</a>. In my opinion this is one of the worst symptoms depressionâ€”you lose both the motivation to do anything, and the ability to enjoy anything (if you were somehow convinced to do it). The simultaneous loss of both cause and effect is extremely disorienting and can quickly cause a feeling of hopelessness.<br><br>
          I wasn't able to snap out of the depressive episode immediately, and I certainly didn't resume all of my previous hobbies, but I was able to return back to a state I can call normal. Moving across the country for college and meeting new friends helped me see life with a new perspective. Also in purely economic terms, with all of my obligations and assignments during the semester, free time really felt like a gift. Even things as simple as going to the gym or cooking dinner became really fun, because either they were a welcome break from studying, or I had someone fun to do them with.<br><br>
          Unfortunately, I must admit I'm experiencing a milder form of anhedonia right now. The quarantine and my university's pass/fail grading policy has allowed me to finally see what I enjoy, and also what I couldn't care less about (academically and in my personal life). I realize now that things even as large as my choice to major in Computer Science were largely influenced by other people (in that case, my dad). <br><br>
          For the first time, I have starting to think about what my life would be like if I lived it 100% for myself. Maybe it sounds crazy that I have lived for 20 years without considering what I wanted for myself, but it's easy for me to live to make someone else proud. Talking with a friend today, I realized that no matter how much effort I spend living for someone else, they can ultimately always leave or die or something. And then I'm left in an unfortunate situation: lots of obligations to things I don't love, and no external validation either. <br><br>
          It might be easier for me to go with the flow in the short run, but I understand now that if I want to enjoy my life in the long run I have to be more selfish. I feel it is of extreme and urgent importance for me to find things that make me, and nobody else, happy. Get in bitches, we're going on a journey of self actualization. I'm going to take some time and do some cheesy activities I find online (like creating a vision board lol) to help find what I actually like doing in life. Maybe I'll even embarass myself and post them here.<br><br>

        <p>
            I have 3 habits that I want to implement in the near future. Reading the book "Atomic Habits" has inspired me. Some of these I had in the past, but have since faded away or I do them too infrequently to call them a real habit. <br><br>
            The habits I am going to implement are:<br><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Waking up before 8am</li>
                <li>Buying nothing</li>
                <li>Running two miles (at least)</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

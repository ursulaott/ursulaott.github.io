            Okay, fine. Moving might be overstating it. But I am going back to my native California for about 2.5 weeks and I'm bringing <i>everything</i> with me. <br><br>
            Dragging my medium suitcase and duffle bag up and down the grimy stairs of the new york subway system made me wish I could afford the triple digit uber fare. Even though I've gotten rid of 80% of the things I used to own, moving serves as a reminder that I still probably have too much. <br><br>
            People who live out of backpacks traveling from country to country are seemingly much happier and more fulfilled than those in cramped urban apartments, and in turn those are seemingly happier than those tied down to a home in suburbia with insuffurable careers and kids.<br><br>
            Many live under the delusion that at some point they have lost control of their life and must follow the set path ahead of them. To believe your freedom does not exist causes your freedom to cease to exist.<br><br>

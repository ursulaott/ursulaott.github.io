            This week I'm reading Leo Tolstoy's <i> War and Peace</i>. Not going to lie, it's dense, and I'm having a bit of a difficult time keeping track of how all of the characters and families interact. However, I can't deny the fact that this book pulls you in. I rate <i> War and Peace</i> 4 out of 5 stars.

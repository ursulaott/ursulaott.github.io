			I'm currently building a cli photo editing tool for one of my classes. I've been reading a lot about image processing over the past few days. Most of the basic blog posts focus on "blurring" the image which is cool I guess but it's not super useful for artistic photo editing like what I want. I realized there is a lot more to colorizing than I thought!

            I have wanted to learn data science for a long time, maybe even years now, but I never really put in the work. Nothing was forcing me to take a deep dive. I did one or two tutorials here and there, but nothing too serious.<br><br>
            Fast forward to today. I now have a reason to learn, and I have time pressure. I need to become at least reasonably well-versed in data science and visualization by next week. I have to gain this skill because I have a technical interview at a company I very very much would like to work for (a hedge fund). <br><br>
            I don't know why it's so hard to force myself to learn when there is no immediate deadline, and giving myself an arbitrary deadline seems almost fake as well. I'm glad this opportunity is forcing me to learn.<br><br>
            For the data science side, I am starting by refreshing my skills in pandas and numpy. For visualization, I am reading <a href="http://gen.lib.rus.ec/search.php?req=9780961392147&lg_topic=libgen&open=0&view=simple&res=25&phrase=1&column=def" target="_blank">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> by Edward Tufte<sup>1</sup>, which is one of the best books I have ever read. I know, I'm a design nerd. Additionally I will be creating my visualizations with Seaborn, so I need to brush up my proficiency on that as well. <br><br>
            Because this company is a hedge fund, I need to make especially sure I am competent in dealing with time series, but of course in an interview you can never be too sure so I will prepare a wider range of types of graphs just in case.<br><br>
            Anyways I will update my progress here and possibly post some of the things I learn and graphs I create on this blog in the future. <br><br>

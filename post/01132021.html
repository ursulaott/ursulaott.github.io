            First week's book finished a little late, on the 11th. Dostoevsky's <i>Crime and Punishment</i> was a very interesting way to start the year. I consumed it largely as an audiobook, with some e-reading here and there. This book inspired me to sign up for a course on russian literature this semester; I am looking forward to reading more of Dostoevsky's work later on this year.<br><br>

            I rate <i>Crime and Punishment</i>  5 out of 5 stars.

			I have eczema. That means my skin sometimes decides to be uncontrollably itchy. I have no self control so I often submit to the urges, itching my skin until it bleeds. When you have eczema, sure itching hurts, but it also feels so <i>good</i>. It's euphoric.<br><br>
			The downside is that I inevitably end up looking like Tomura Shigaraki. Uncannily so, I itch my eyes and neck the most, same as him. Maybe that's why he's my favorite character <3. Same type of messed up. Honestly I wish I could wear a severed hand to cover my face too.  <br><br>

		Anyways this brings us to the topic of real self harm. Only this week have I admitted to a close friend that I do it. And now it's going publicly on the internet, kinda ironic. I keep coming back to it. It just feels so good and euphoric. It is scratching an itch that I feel not only physically, but also on a deeper spiritual level. It's the epitome of in-the-momentness for me, a meditative experience that clears my mind. It's impossible to describe how truly wondeful it is to be so in my body and in the moment after feeling so gone after experiencing dissociation. <br><br>
		Everything started with me itching as a kid and it kept going and now here we are. The two things can't really be separated. If I had to guess I would tell you that I'm going to coninue intermittently participating in this behavior for the rest of my life, though I couldn't be sure. Maybe I will tattoo over the areas I normally turn to so I will feel guilty about destroying the art. Who knows. <br><br>
		So anyways. If you read this and you know me, we can talk about it if you want. I'll probably joke about it because that's the best way I know how to deal with things. If you asked about my scars before, I lied to you about where they were from. I'm sorry. But now you know I guess. <br><br>

            This week I was on the recieving end of a coffee chat, the more qualified one, for a first time ever, and I realized I'm not qualified. I am so not qualified to give advice on any of this. I don't know what I'm doing at all. I'm not sure how honest I'm supposed to be about my reasonings as well. I literally chose my job to make money. I haven't decided on my career path yet. I try my best to be helpful but damn it feels disingenuous to be the one giving advice.

          CGPGrey, the youtuber, makes a point that abstract themes often lead to more personal growth than concrete goals. What does that mean? Instead of comitting to running five miles a day, or going to the gym 6 times a week, you will choose a theme of fitness. Your choices to act along this theme are much more flexible than just following one set goal.<br><br>
          During this shelter-in-place in California I have been working on a few themes to improve myself. They are fitness, food, and finding peace.<br><br>
          My fitness theme is fairly self explanatory. I have been running, and not taking more than two days off in a row as far as my workouts.<br><br>
          My food theme mostly involves cooking. I'm by no means a chef, so I still have to follow recipes, and sometimes I fail. I've been trying to master the more difficult techniques involved in making pastries, like macronage, or the endless lamination of croissant dough, with mixed results. One day I want to be at the point where I can create my own recipes, instead of following them, but I understand I must master the basic techniques first.<br><br>
          Finally, the theme of finding peace has largely manifested through mindfulness. Going through a trauamtic period of loss isn't easy for anyone, and I think my anxiety sometimes makes it worse. Nevertheless, I've been meditating for as long as I can stand every day, and letting myself have time to just sit and process the thoughts that come by.<br><br>
          Concrete goals and quantitative metrics have always had their place in my self-improvement journey, but I have been enjoying the flexibility of themes. Maybe they will eventually become too vague to be effective, but for now they are what I'm following.<br><br>

          <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Abortion</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Should always be allowed in the early stages, no questions asked. In later stages, it's crucial to consider a physician's advice, as the procedure can carry increased risk. Prioritizing the life of the mother is important.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Affirmative Action</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>To be honest I have a much more complex view of this now than I used to. I think the current system highly disadvantages Asian-Americans, and an ideal system should be based more on socioeconomic class than race/ethnicity.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Alternative medicine</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>The FDA should have the ability to regulate any dietary supplement. From the </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/what-you-need-know-about-dietary-supplements"><span>FDA website</span></a><span> &ldquo; </span><span>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (</span><span>FDA</span><span>) does not have the authority to review dietary </span><span>supplement</span><span> products for safety and effectiveness before they are marketed.&rdquo;</span><span> Sounds pretty sketchy to me.&nbsp;</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>America's global influence</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>I haven't thought about this much as an American, maybe that says a lot.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Artificial intelligence</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>AI innovation is probably going to decimate a lot of the jobs that currently exist. As a society we need to plan for that. At this point I believe AI innovation is good for humanity overall and we should continue. I think the &ldquo;singularity&rdquo; probably won't happen in my lifetime, but I won't say I think it's impossible.&nbsp;</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Assisted suicide</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>People should have free choice about what happens to their body above the age of consent. Suicide is not a chocie that is made lightly. It's only humane to let people in the terminal stages of illness end their own suffering.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Atheism</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Despite the arrogance of many atheists, I think organized religion is far more toxic to society. I don't think atheists have much influence at all, which is by design.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Beauty</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>There should not be one unified standard for what is considered beautiful. Diverse representation in media is important.&nbsp;</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Bilingual education</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Kids should learn at least one additional language in school, and they should have multiple dissimilar languages to select from. I'm taking Mandarin right now and I wish it was available to me earlier. I have never heard of any possible downside to teaching additional languages.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Biofuels</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>We need to switch to renewable energy options as soon as possible.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Born gay</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Sexual orientation and gender identity is not a choice. It's okay for someone to be unsure of their identity or sexuality.&nbsp;</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Capital punishment</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>I'm not really sure how I feel about it.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Censorship</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>A very complicated topic. Deplatforming hate speech is not censorship in my estimation. Freedom of speech is valuable overall and we need to protect it.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>
  <p><span>Childhood obesity</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Allowing your child to become obese is never okay. Children can't make their own health decisions, so the parents need to step up. It's okay for the child's doctor to stage an intervention.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Civil rights</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Humans deserve human rights. This shouldn't be controversial in 2020.&nbsp;</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Climate change</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>The biggest problem we face. Everyone needs to be more aware of their impact and work to decrease it.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Cryptocurrency</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>I personally don't have anything against it, but I also won't choose to put my own money into it.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Cyber bullying</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Is not as big of an issue as a lot of boomers say it is</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Drinking age</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Most teens try alcohol at 18 or earlier. I think a drinking age of 18 may be appropriate, especially to purchase lower alcohol content beverages. We should choose the drinking age based on decreasing the risk of drunk driving. I would agree with whatever age minimizes this risk.&nbsp;</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Drug legalization</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>An extremely complicated topic. Drugs range a lot in danger/therapeutic effect. Broadly we should probably decriminalize drug use, and regulate the sale and production of these substances.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Eating disorders</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Are much more severe and complicated than most people realize. Most involve body dysmorphia. Once someone has suffered from an eating disorder, it will never go away, it only becomes less powerful.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Extremism</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>A bad thing.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Factory farming</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Necessary to support our growing population, but environmental effects need to be seriously examined.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Foreign aid</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Generally a bad thing except in the case of immediate crisis relief. Promotes a reliance mentality, instead of empowering the foreign economy.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Fracking</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Harmful to the environment, and should eventually be stopped.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Free college</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>I think the most basic level of college, such as community college, should be free or extremely cheap. Other options can vary in price depending on amenities offered.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Freedom of speech</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Necessary and should be protected. Hate speech and credible threats of violence are not protected.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Gay marriage</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Is a human right, and harms nobody.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Genetic engineering</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>We should (carefully) push the boundaries as far as we can.&nbsp;</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Gun control</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>The second amendment does not provide unlimited rights. I think some people should be allowed to own guns, but far less than the current amount. I think it's best to err on the side of caution in this case.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Hacking</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Security is not optional. If someone owns a system, they need to test and protect its security.&nbsp;</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Health insurance</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>People should not be punished for getting sick.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Immigration</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Immigration is nearly always a good thing. Across the board, we need to broaden options for legal immigration. For high-end technical jobs down to low-end farming jobs, immigrants are crucial to the health of the US economy.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Labor unions</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Not quite sure how I feel about them.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Minimum wage</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Minimum wage should be enough to cover housing and food for one person working full time. This is currently the case in zero US states.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Nuclear energy</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Probably one of the better options we have, if used carefully.&nbsp;</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Organic food</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Though there are no real health effects, the decreased use of chemical herbicides and pesticides is likely good for the environment.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Offshore drilling</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Needs to be stopped, now.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Outsourcing</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>I don't see anything wrong with it. Labor works best as a market system.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Racial profiling</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Is very real and very harmful. Biases exist within everyone, but as adults we can choose not to act on them.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Reparations</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Not quite sure how I feel</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Screen addiction</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Oh man, I'm addicted to screens, especially during quarantine. I tend to remember and enjoy non-screen activities more. I think this is generally agreed upon.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Self-driving cars</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>I live in the epicenter of self-driving car research, and overall I think I like them. They will make driving safer for everyone.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Sex education</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Needs to be more widespread, and must be science-based.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Smart speakers</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Amazon, Google, Apple, etc. can see our every move anyways. Resistance is futile.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Social security</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>UBI makes the most sense to me</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Standardized testing</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Is necessary to compare students across schools. They don't measure intelligence, but they do measure the ability to be disciplined enough to study a lot.&nbsp;</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Stem cells</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Stem cell researchers should be allowed to try whatever they believe could be helpful. Embryos are not people.&nbsp;</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Sweatshops</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Everyone should pay more attention to how their goods are produced. Ethical production standards need to become the norm.&nbsp;</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Title IX</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Discrimination based on gender is never good. I don't know why that's controversial.&nbsp;</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Urban agriculture</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Is cool and more people should do it.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Vaccines</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Are necessary to the health of society.&nbsp;</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Vaping</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>I don't believe vaping is safe, so I personally don't do it. I don't have anything against other people doing it, if they know the risks. I think vaping is probably safer than smoking.</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Violence in the media</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Clickbait works</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Women's rights</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Are human rights, this shouldn't be controversial</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>Zero tolerance policies</span></p>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><span>For sexual harassment and the like, zero tolerance is the only acceptable policy</span></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </ul>

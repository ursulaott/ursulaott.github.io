          It's a new month and my classes are finally finally winding down for finals. I thought I'd update on my themes for April, and write down my goals for this month.<br><br>
          As for my three themes, they worked, but not as well as I wanted them too. I'm not a person who deals well with things that are vague. I like things to be clearly scheduled and defined. So I'm going back to clear goals this month. I did improve my fitness a lot from where it was before, I'm better at cooking, and I'm slightly more mentally stable. Again, the themes worked, but I can do better with more specific goals.<br><br>
          My first goal is skincare. I've already been working on it for a while but I want to keep up a 2x daily routine. Watching too many videos has me paranoid about sun damage and stuff, so I don't think this one will be too hard. My skin looks a lot better than it did a few months ago, but I want it to be <i>perfect</i>. I wanna have glass skin. And I will! Because I'm never going to skip my routine. <br><br>
          The other goal I'm working on it to work on my product skills. I'm focusing on learning about progressive web apps, using google's web.dev tutorial series. I chose this because I like the design priciples behind PWA and I think it will be useful to make sure my products later remain fast as they scale. I have been very inspired to challenge myself to create ugly but functional products (which is super fucking hard for me because I'm all about the a e s t h e t i c of everything) after listening to the surveymonkey episode of masters of scale.<br><br>
          I want to finish all of their code labs by the end of this month, and maybe even have an mvp for my own project. I'm not going to put too much pressure on that though, because I have most of the summer to work now that my internship has been decimated. I have one idea for a project (it's the opposite of something a cis male tech bro would be interested in), which is why I think it doesn't exist yet. It seems promising, but I'm not going to count my chickens before they hatch.<br><br>

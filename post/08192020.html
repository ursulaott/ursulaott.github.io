            I think it's fair to say this year has been chaotic. Lots of people hated 2020 so far, and they have good reason to. However, despite all of the Bad and Terrible happenings, I've been having a good time. <br><br>
            Maybe it's a curse but I think I thrive the most in these chaotic situations. I'm happier than I've been in years. Maybe it's that I finally got on the right meds, maybe it's my fulfillment from my career progress, the fact that I started watching anime, or simply the fact that I don't have to interact with many people these days. Whatever it is, I don't know, but I'm happy. Things are good. I'm very excited for this semetser. I took risks, and they paid off. And I'm going to remember that lesson for the future.

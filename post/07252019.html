            I own too many things, and I have too little money. I think this is a relatable problem for nearly all Americans. A problem that plages the population and causes endless debt, clutter, and sadness.<br><br>
            The solution to this massive problem is also ridiculously simple. Two words: Buy Nothing.<br><br>
            To many, this may not even seem possible. How could I possibly do that in New York City, especially for an extended period of time?<br><br>
            I will be using what I already have, and asking to borrow things that I do not own from friends. Novel concept, right?<br><br>
            I am putting myself to the test. Buy nothing for 3 days. Use what I have. 3 days is at once very short and very long. If it goes well, I will attempt the whole next week. <br><br>

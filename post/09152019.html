            When you stretch into the splits, your legs hurt, but it's ok because they must hurt if you want to become more flexible. You extend yourself to what you think is the maximum, and you make good progress. It hurts, yes, but you are heading quickly towards your goal. <br><br>
            One day, it hurts a lot. But it always hurts a lot. The pain is fire but you push through it. You're strong. It hurt more the first day. Your legs are both going so far on their own opposite courses, and the rest of you keeps following them in two directions at once. <br><br>
            *Crack*<br><br>
            You collapse. <br><br>
            You see black, then the world comes hazily into view. Your legs no longer belong to you, they belong to a demon who is hacking them off with a steak knife. You have overextended.<br><br>
            I have overextended.<br><br>

        <h2> femininity and power </h2>

            My social media "fast" of sorts for these past five days has left me a lot of extra time in which I have been able to contemplate life, read, and gather aesthetic inspiration. As a person, I am highly attunted to the aesthetic, and though it may seem shallow, I care deeply about the appearance and experience of the spaces I inhibit. <br><br>
            The past few years of my life have been driven largely by a search to gain power and respect within society, whether by gaining access to an elite university (and therefore social group), pushing myself to gain knowledge in the academic setting, or working to advance my career, I have spent most of my time in the interest of gaining power. Along the way, there has been a direct correlation between appearing less feminine and being able to hold more influence. <br><br>
            This never really bothered me, as a girl who hosted an insect-themed birthday party at age seven, and who pursued some of the most male-dominated fields of study in existentence. I have become used to pushing myself into a very unfeminine box, and I was content with it. My demeanor became artificially brash and confident, my clothing in more masculine silouhettes, and no makeup to speak of. In high school I would often remark on wishing that I had been born male, because it would make my goals much easier to achieve. I was so tired of the skeptical looks and snide comments, but I had to go along with it and pretend everything was fine. <br><br>
            It is almost as if men will not trust a woman intellectually unless she is almost a man herself. She must be, as the trope states, "not like the other girls".<br><br>
            I'm tired of this bullshit. I'm exactly like the other girls, and the other girls are strong and powerful in a way that men can never be. I'm tired of forcing myself to pretend to care about things I don't like, to downplay my femininity in demeanor and physical appearance, and to pretend like I am above having emotions. <br><br>
            My boyfriend recently brought up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia">PayPal Mafia</a>, a group of wealthy and powerful silicon valley investors and technologists. I was immediately inspired and felt a desire to be part of such a group someday. Reality came crashing down a few seconds later as I saw that there was not one woman within the twenty or so strong group. <br><br>
            Every time something like this happens I feel a sense of defeat. I don't even know if it's worth it for me to pursue these dreams anymore, especially if I want to maintain an authentic sense of self and not conform to masculine standards of strength.<br><br>
            Anyways I think this just goes to say that I am going to stop my immense effort to conform to an impossible standard, and allow myself to be free with the person I really am. Maybe I might seem more shallow or silly or girly, but that's ok. It's who I am.<br><br>

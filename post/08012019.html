            I was born with anxiety.<br><br>
            Back then, I didn't know it. As a kid, just slightly more worried than my classmates. My condition flew under the radar for almost seventeen years. <br><br>
            In high school my anxiety eventually become so chronic and severe that I had to take a step back from my normal life. Coupled with depression, my anxiety was responsible for a nosedive in the quality of my life. I was constantly in and out of therapy appointments, crying every last tear I held, unable to cry, laying in bed unable to get up and shower, and worrying about getting into college and even about graduating high school. It is safe to say this was the worst period in my life to date. <br><br>
            Fast forward to now; I have completed my first year of college and am feeling a lot better for the most part. However, things are not always good. I suffer from the occasional severe panic attack, but worse than that, I have constant feelings in the back of my mind that something horrible is going to happen. <br><br>
            Most times, I can ignore them, but some times I really wish they would just go away. I wish I could just have a few hours to not think of anything, to breathe and exist without thoughts.<br><br>
            I'm not the best at managing my anxiety. Others might meditate, go to weekly therapy, or deal with their condition in other ways. Most of the time, I do nothing. It's eating away at my mind, but I always do nothing. Maybe I'll start acting on it soon, but for now I don't even know where I would start. <br><br>

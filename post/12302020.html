            In 2021 I'm reviving my "book a week" challenge, where I, as the name suggests, read a book every week. I'm going to write about it here. My first few are going to be as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>a monk's guide to a clean house and mind(re-read)</li>
                <li>crime and punishment</li>
                <li> no longer human</li>
                <li>the secret history (re-read)</li>
            </ol>

            If you want to suggest a book for my challenge, feel free to drop me a line on <a href="https://twitter.com/ursula_ott">twitter</a>.

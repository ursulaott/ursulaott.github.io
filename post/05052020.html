          Reading back over my posts, I always cringe a little. I'm certainly not a good writer, and the topics I choose to focus on don't help much either. I compare myself to others far too often. Sometimes I wonder if I should spend a lot more time on these, add pictures, make the UI more fancy, edit my writing, etc. <br><br>
          The only thing I can really do is take solace in the fact that shipping is good. Shipping is the most important part of the creative process. Like Reid Hoffman says, "If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late." I am thouroughly embarassed by these posts so I guess I must be launching them on time.<br><br>

        <h2> on cleaning </h2>

          I'm currently reading <i>A Monk's Guide to a Clean House and Mind</i>, and it has brought me to some important insights about one of my favorite activities: cleaning. I don't know why cleaning is a taboo subject in American culture. It's seen as something only done by the lower class, something to be kept out of sight. It's a chore, in the worst sense of the word. Nevertheless, cleaning my belongings has always given me a sense of calm and satisfation, even as a child. <br><br>
          In the book, Shoukei Matsumoto draws many parallels between the cleaning of the outer world, and the cleansing of the inner one. He likens the removal of grime from objects to the removal of stubborn anxious thoughts in the mind. Anyone who has spent time in a cluttered space knows that it will eventually take a toll on the mind, likewise a clean space sets the mind up for calm. <br><br>
          Matsumoto's view of garbage also resonated with me. In the book he wonders: "What is garbage exactly? Things that are dirty, worn out, unusable, no longer useful, no longer needed, and so on. And yet nothing starts out as garbage. Things become garbage when they are treated as garbage."

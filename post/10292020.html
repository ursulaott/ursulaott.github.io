            Normally I don't really notice my anxiety anymore, especially as I've been getting treatment over the past year. Lately though it's been getting worse and I have been having physical symptoms. I often will notice my hands are clenched into fists. I've been getting migrane headaches for days on end as well. Sometimes my hands shake so that I can't even take notes with pen anymore. <br><br>
            Though it's been annoying, I think these physical manifestations have been important for me. I realized that I can't ignore what's going on in my head. My brain is fundamentally still part of my body, and an important one at that. <br><br>
            In these stressful days, it's important to tune in to your body and pay attention. Best to make sure you maintain your mental health lest you also get the migranes and the shakes. <br><br>

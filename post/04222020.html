          Now that I have so much free time I've been able to get back in touch with what I love. I'm writing this because I want to remember what made me happy in these strange quarantine days.<br>
          <ul>
            <li>taking a walk for 2 or 3 hours to main street cupertino or just around the neighborhood</li>
            <li>listening to masters of scale during my walks </li>
            <li>calling a friend to talk about random ideas</li>
            <li>mastering a tricky recipe (croissants)</li>
            <li>drinking a mint mojito from philz, when i can get there before they close super early</li>
            <li>looking at all of the plants around the apple campus</li>
            <li>looking at videos and pictures of matcha the baby turtle</li>
          </ul>
<br>
          Honestly walking for 2 hours a day is changing my life. I don't have much else to do, and it's making my anxiety so much less prevalent in my thought patterns. I don't think it's sustainable to keep up the habit during school but I will for sure try to incorporate it into my routine now that I feel the benefits.

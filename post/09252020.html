		How many people have I been in the past year/years? I think it's a lot. I tend to change myself often depending on how I feel and who I want to be. Maybe once per year or so it happens, sometimes more or less than that. I don't know if this inconsisency is a good or bad thing but it is definitely there. A lot of the time it also involves me changing my outward appearance but not always. After this constant cycle I'm really not sure who I actually am anymore. My mental health issues don't help either, dealing with DPDR makes me feel like I don't exist at all a lot of the time anyways.<br><br>
		Anyways these past few days I decided it's time for me to be someone new. After being so many people I want to find out who I really actually am on the inside. Without the influence of anyone else. I have a tendency of copying my friends and people I look up to. I think everyone does this to an extent. But now that I have the opportunity, I'm going to stage an experiment. <br><br>
	Who would I be if nobody was there for me to copy? What if I ceased to exist? I have a feeling there might be nothing at the core and I'll be completely empty. The zen buddhist inside of me finds that really appealing. <br>

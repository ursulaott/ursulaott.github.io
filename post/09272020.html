			I've been challenging myself to a few things lately. First, I've been learning to type the right way. I have no clue how I never acquired this skill and nonetheless survived this far into my life but here we are. I stopped using an IDE and started using vim, to make my dad proud. It's been mediocre and I have to look up the shortcuts a lot but I'm getting better. It makes me feel cool and smart so I'm gonna keep doing it.<br><br>
I've been having a good time with the cutting contact from my irls challenge, I'm so much more productive!! Plus I have a server full of online friends so maybe irl friends are overrated anyways. Maybe they've just been slowing me down. <br><br>

For a minimalism type challenge I only brought one bag of stuff to hawaii. It's been great! I think I even brought too much honestly. My food budget is really small, and I often eat from what's being grown on this property. Finally, I've challenged myself to exercise daily. Yesterday I swam in the ocean for an hour and the day before I hiked to the top of the mountain behind my house. So yeah, I love setting arbitrary challenges for myself! It's like a game or something. This week I'm going to challenge myself to bullet journal every day and not slack off-will update!!

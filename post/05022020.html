          Or, beauty as a matter of life and death.<br><br>
          I don't know why this took me so long, but I finally realized what I have in common with my two best friends. We are all obsessed with aesthetics. We go out of our way to find things that are beautiful, to caputure them, and share them with each other. Maybe, a long time ago when we first met, we weren't like this. But nowadays all three of us spend great chunks of our life chasing aesthetically pleasing experiences. It's a big reason the dark academia genre appeals to me so much. <br><br>
          One of the only philosophical things that stuck with my from high school was learning about the inextricably intertwined realtionship between Truth, Beauty, and Goodness. Things can't be one without having some qualities of the others.<br><br>
          It's not too hard for me to fall into being passively suicidal. Life can get too boring; I'll go one day too many wihtout a good experience, and all of a sudden I'll have convinced myself it will be this bland forever. I find myself with no convincing reasons to stick around. It's way too easy for me to slip into believing the world is a horrible place. Or worse, a boring one.<br><br>
          This is why we go. Alone and together: on trips to see the world temporarily through a lens that only understands the perfect and the good. <br><br>
          I don't go on these trips for the sake of photography or social media, none of us do. I frankly don't really care who sees the photos I take. The real, honest, deep-down reason I do these ridiculous excursions is because I want an excuse to make myself see a world that is beatiful and worth staying alive for.<br><br>
          So yes, I care a little bit too much about museums and cafes and mountain sunrises. I spend a little too long framing the perfect shot, and editing a photo I know will never see the light of someone's feed. My list of beautiful and overpriced restaurants I want to visit is way too long. But without these things I probably wouldn't be here, so I'm not going to stop. All that is beautiful, is true, is good.<br><br>

          One big way I've been procrastinating for the past few months is by browing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/">r/analog</a>. Film photography has always been intimidating to me, I have only to date dipped my toe into polaroids and disposables. <br><br>
          I had a good long conversations with one of my friends today, in which we discussed analog photography. We agreed there is some inexplicable, ethereal, and at times magical property that exists within film that digital mediums cannot replicate.<br><br>
          In the age of Instagram filters, VSCO, and lightroom, it's easier than ever to create a false vintage effect. Presets and grain effects take seconds to apply, and can be utilized by even the most inexperienced camera wielders. I'm certainly guilty of using them. My hypothesis is what makes genuine film photos distinguishable from their digitally-based counterparts is the degree of selectivity in the creative process. When the price of an exposure goes from a few dollars to zero, it's no wonder we wade through hundreds of identical shots.<br><br>
          As time goes on my relationship with creating art has become more complicated. Nowadays, I often explicitly set out to create "shareable" content that fits seamlessly into my Instagram feed. Does anyone care about this feed? Absolutly fucking not. I'm the only one that cares. Nevertheless this has put a lot of strain on what I feel like I have the freedom to create. What used to be an activity that would allow me freedom from anxiety is now a cause of it. I feel intense pressure to ensure continuity with my online presence.<br><br>

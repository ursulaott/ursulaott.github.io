        <h2> big beliefs </h2>

        <p>
          In order to grow and develop as a person, beliefs <i>must</i> change over time as new evidence is introduced. I thought it would be a fun exercise to evaluate my beliefs about certain big topics, and revisit them later to see how I've changed. I'm taking <a href-"https://libguides.umflint.edu/topics/current">this list</a> as a reference guide, but also am going to add a few extras on top. There is a much more extensive list on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_controversial_issues">Wikipedia</a> for the curious. Side note⁠—I find it extremely strange that a person existing in and of themselves can be controversial, but I guess that's just anoter belief I can add to the list.<br><br>

            I listed everything out <a href="/beliefs.html">here</a>, and I'm setting a reminder to re-evaluate all of these on this day in 2021.
